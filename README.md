# Clan-Family-Hub

Implemented a prototype android application with web dashboard for family Security and Networking. With this private mobile app, your family is always with you, no matter where they are. You can share photos, audio, and notes, keep a running list of reminders, tasks and important dates and even pinpoint exactly where everyone is, in real time. And best of all, by only inviting those you wish to join your group, CLAN stays cosy and secure.
You might say itâ€™s kinda like a social network, but for the one group of people you actually care about: your family.
Features: Location tracking & sharing, reminder, chat, SOS, Family wall, Force a Sound, Track via Web and Emergency Alerts.
